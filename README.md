due to lazyness and no setup currently:

clone all files to ~/singularity/

create following folders:
~/singularity/data/
~/singularity/images/
~/singularity/localstorage/
~/singularity/results/

the number in settings says, how many images are running parallel

each runthrough saves results of all machines in ./results/n.result, where n increments every run
